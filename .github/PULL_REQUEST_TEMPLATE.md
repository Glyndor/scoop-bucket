## Summary

<!-- What does this PR do? 1-3 bullet points. -->

## Changes

<!-- List the main changes made. -->

## Test plan

<!-- How was this tested? Check all that apply. -->

- [ ] `./tests/*.test.sh` pass locally
- [ ] `shellcheck scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh` is clean
- [ ] Manifests validate (`./scripts/artifacts/check-manifests.sh`), for changes to `bucket/` or the renderer

<!--
A test that was not watched fail is not a test. If this PR adds or changes a
check, say which control you removed to make it go red, and what it reported.
A sabotage lies when it changed nothing, changed something the test does not
look at, made the test red for a different reason, or was confirmed by the same
tool that made it.
-->

- [ ] New or changed checks were verified by deleting the control and watching them fail
