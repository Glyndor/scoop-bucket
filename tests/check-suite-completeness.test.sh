#
# Run every test file the workflow invokes and require each one to print its
# sentinel. The sentinel is the last line every test file writes:
#
#     printf 'DONE %s %d %d\n' "${BASH_SOURCE[0]##*/}" "$pass" "$fail"
#
# It sits between the count line and `[ "$fail" -eq 0 ]`, so it is reached
# only after the last `check` runs. A test that exits early -- because
# someone planted `exit 0`, because `set -e` killed it on an unexpected
# error, or because anything else cut the run short -- never produces the
# sentinel, and this file names it.
#
# Why this shape, not the alternatives:
#
#   * a sidecar file. Every test would have to know the sidecar path and
#     append to it; that is plumbing into every file for one check's sake,
#     and a non-writable sidecar is a new failure mode unrelated to what
#     this catches.
#
#   * a post-hoc re-run. The chain in tests.yml runs the tests once, and
#     this file re-runs them to inspect their output. Tests that take a
#     minute to run would take two; the doubling is the cheapest cost, but
#     the property -- the test that just passed is the one whose sentinel
#     we are about to check -- is no longer true.
#
#   * parsing tests.yml inside this file. The list of files is right
#     there in the workflow, but a runner that parses YAML to find its own
#     input couples itself to the workflow's shape. The workflow lists
#     the tests as this file's arguments; that is the one place the list
#     needs to live, and tests/ci-runs-every-test.test.sh already keeps
#     it honest.
#
# Usage: check-suite-completeness.test.sh <test-file> [<test-file> ...]
