# Tests for scripts/check-dco-on-main.sh -- the detector that reports a human
# commit reaching `main` without a Signed-off-by trailer.
#
# The bot exemption is the case worth having twice. It must skip commits the bot
# authored, and it must NOT skip a human commit that merely resembles one: if
# the exemption keyed on the message rather than the author, anyone could evade
# the check by copying the bot's subject line.
#
# Requires: git.
