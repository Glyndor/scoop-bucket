# Tests for scripts/check-render-drift.sh.
#
# The contract being tested:
#
#   * three named units (verify_sha256sums, py_block, hash_of) inside the
#     local render script must stay byte-identical (after stripping comments
#     and blanks) to the same units inside the sibling's differently-named
#     render script;
#   * render_product is excluded on purpose, and a change inside it must not
#     turn the check red;
#   * comment-only changes are tolerated (comments legitimately describe each
#     repository);
#   * a unit renamed on the remote side fails loudly with the unit's name;
#   * a network failure is reported as a fetch failure, not as drift;
#   * the script refuses to pass having compared nothing.
#
# Network is stubbed: a fake `curl` reads $CURL_STUB_FILE and prints it (or
# fails, if $CURL_STUB_FAIL is set). Nothing here reaches GitHub.
