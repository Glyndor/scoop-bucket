# A cron that stops firing emits nothing at all, and "no alert" is
# indistinguishable from "all clear." This gate turns that silence into a
# red check on ordinary work, by treating the newest successful scheduled
# run as evidence the cron is alive, and failing when that signal is too
# old or absent.
#
# The step depends on GH_TOKEN, REPO, WORKFLOW, and MAX_AGE_DAYS from the
# environment; the only network call is a single `gh api ... --jq ...`. A
# fake `gh` on PATH records the URL it was called with and serves a canned
# response, so the cases below exercise the real shell with a deterministic
# API rather than mocking the workflow itself.

# Requires: python3, GNU date (for `date -u -d`).
