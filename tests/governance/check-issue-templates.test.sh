# Tests for scripts/governance/check-issue-templates.sh -- the check that keeps the
# bug report template asking for this channel's platform and install method.
#
# The template it guards was copied from another channel and never adapted: it
# asked for a Linux distribution and offered `install.sh`, neither of which
# exists here. Both directions are exercised below -- a template that names
# this channel is accepted, and every way of being wrong again is refused with
# a message that says which one it was. A check that only refused things would
# pass every refusal and fail the acceptance, which is why the acceptance comes
# first and why each refusal asserts the reason and not just the exit code.
#
# The refusals run against fixture trees, not against this repository's own
# template, so they can be exercised without breaking the repository. The last
# case runs against the real template: that is the one that goes red when the
# template drifts, and it is the reason this test exists.
#
# Requires: bash, awk, grep, sed, find.
