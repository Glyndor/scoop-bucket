# Tests for the shell inside .github/workflows/update.yml.
#
# That workflow decides, on every scheduled run, whether to commit to `main` —
# and it commits without a pull request, so its decisions are the last thing
# standing between a bad render and `scoop install`. Three of them are ours
# rather than GitHub's:
#
#   - the generator's exit code becomes `partial`, and only an unexpected code
#     aborts the run; exit 3 (some products skipped) must carry on so the
#     products that did render still reach users
#   - `changed` decides whether anything is committed at all
#   - an emptied bucket/ must never be committed
#
# The `run:` blocks are extracted from the workflow and executed as they ship,
# rather than copied here. A copy would pass while the workflow rots.
#
# Not covered, and not coverable without the Actions engine: the `if:`
# conditions wiring these outputs to the later steps, and the createCommitOnBranch
# call itself. Those are asserted by reading the workflow, not by running it.
#
# Requires: python3, git.
