# Tests for scripts/check-products-consistent.sh -- the check that PRODUCTS,
# the README table and bucket/ still agree.
#
# This check lived inline in ci.yml, where nothing could reach it. It is the
# only thing standing between a product being declared and a formula for it
# actually existing, so it needs to fail for the right reason rather than pass
# for any reason.
#
# The collation case is the one worth having. `sort -u` compares under the
# environment's collation and UTF-8 collations ignore punctuation at the
# primary level, so `pod-up` and `podup` compare EQUAL and one is dropped from
# whichever list holds both. Two lists that genuinely differ then compare the
# same and the check exits 0 over real drift.
#
# Requires: nothing beyond coreutils.

# declares both. The script pins LC_ALL=C; this case is what proves it.
