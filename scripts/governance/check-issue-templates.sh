# scripts/governance/check-issue-templates.sh -- the issue templates must ask for
# the platform this channel installs on, and for an install method that exists
# here.
#
# The bug report template is the first thing a user meets when something breaks.
# It asks two questions -- which operating system, and which version and how did
# you install it -- and both have to be answerable in this channel, or the
# reporter writes something the maintainer cannot use.
#
# The template was copied from another channel and never adapted. It offered
# "e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 42" as the operating system and
# "v0.3.1 (install.sh)" as the version. Neither belongs here: this channel
# installs with `scoop install <product>` and runs on Windows, and `install.sh`
# is a script in the product repositories, not in this one. The field is
# required, so the reporter had to answer it, with the wrong example in front of
# them.
#
# The install command is not written down here. It is read out of the README's
# own Install section, and the product it names is checked against the files
# this channel actually serves, so the template cannot drift away from the
# command the README documents without this going red.
#
# What it refuses, and what it says in each case:
#
#   * an operating system field that does not name this channel's platform
#   * an operating system field that names a platform this channel does not serve
#   * an operating system field that does not ask for the package manager's
#     version, which is half of what tells one installation from another
#   * a version field that does not name the install command the README
#     documents
#   * a template that names an install method this channel does not have
#
# And it fails loudly when it cannot read what it needs: a template without
# those two fields, a README without an install command, a channel with no
# product files. A checker that cannot read the answer reports nothing, and
# nothing reads as agreement.
#
# Usage: check-issue-templates.sh [repo-root]   (default: the repo this lives in)
