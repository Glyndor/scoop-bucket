# Fail when this repository's render script has drifted from the equivalent
# script in the sibling repository.
#
# WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS
#
#   The homebrew-tap and scoop-bucket repositories each carry their own render
#   script. They are NOT copies of each other -- one renders Ruby formulae, the
#   other JSON manifests -- but the verification logic they share is what
#   decides whether a release is trusted. Nothing about what is signed, how the
#   signature is verified, or how the SHA256 is matched should ever depend on
#   which package manager is being targeted.
#
#   Until this script existed, the only thing keeping that shared logic in step
#   was somebody remembering to apply a fix in both places, which is care
#   rather than a mechanism, and care does not survive a busy week.
#
# WHAT IS COMPARED
#
#   Four named units inside the script:
#
#       verify_sha256sums  the function that fetches SHA256SUMS + .sig and
#                         verifies the Ed25519 signature against the
#                         configured release keys
#       py_block          the embedded python block, from <<'PY' to PY, that
#                         does the actual signature verification
#       hash_of           the function that pulls a single asset's hex digest
#                         out of the verified SHA256SUMS
#       release_keys      the two top-level RELEASE_PUBKEY_B64= and
#                         RELEASE_PUBKEY2_B64= declarations. The logic is
#                         identical on both sides; the keys themselves are not.
#                         A rotation applied in one channel and not the other
#                         leaves both scripts accepting different signing keys,
#                         and every check stays green because the code matches.
#       verify_attestation the function that downloads one asset, checks its
#                         digest against the SHA256SUMS entry, and runs
#                         `gh attestation verify` with --source-ref pinned
#                         to the tag being rendered. The signature on
#                         SHA256SUMS proves the digests came from this
#                         product's release, not that the release is the
#                         genuine one for the tag: an actor who can publish
#                         a release can re-upload last year's binaries with
#                         the matching old signed SHA256SUMS. The
#                         attestation is what binds the binary to the tag.
#                         This is shared logic and belongs in the contract.
#
#   render_product is EXCLUDED by name, with the reason given below. The two
#   repositories render to different formats, so the function legitimately
#   differs. A check that went red on it would be switched off within a week;
#   keeping it named below is the only thing that makes the exclusion legible
#   to whoever next looks at this script.
#
# HOW THE COMPARISON IS MADE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BYTE COMPARISON
#
#   Comments and blank lines are stripped from both sides before the diff.
#   Comments in these files legitimately describe their own repository, and a
#   gate that goes red for a correct comment edit is a gate people learn to
#   click past.
#
# WHERE THE SIBLING IS READ FROM
#
#   Over HTTPS from raw.githubusercontent.com. The repositories are public, so
#   no token is needed; a token would give a drift reporter write reach it has
#   no business having.
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, KEPT DISTINCT ON PURPOSE
#
#   drift            a compared unit's logic differs; the diff is printed
#   fetch failure    GitHub could not be reached, or answered with nothing.
#                    This is NOT reported as drift. Conflating an unreachable
#                    network with a real disagreement teaches people that a
#                    red check means "try again later", which is exactly the
#                    habit that lets a genuine one through.
#   nothing compared refuse to pass having inspected nothing (see the bottom).
#
