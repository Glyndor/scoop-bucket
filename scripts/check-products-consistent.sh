# scripts/render-manifests.sh's PRODUCTS table is the only place a product is
# declared. bucket/ restates it and cannot be generated from the check itself, so
# this compares the two: a product added to PRODUCTS without re-running the
# generator leaves a directory that is a correct artefact of an obsolete input.
# "Generated" says where a file came from, not when.
#
# The README's table is NOT checked, deliberately, and was until 2026-08-26.
#
# It made editing prose break CI. The comparison parsed a markdown table with
# awk, so renaming the heading or adding a column reported every product as
# missing -- which happened while porting this check between the two
# repositories, where one says "Formula" and the other "Manifest". The check was
# wrong and the README was fine.
#
# And it compared two things a person maintains by hand, which anyone can
# reconcile by editing whichever is easier rather than whichever is right. That
# is not a check against ground truth; it is two documents agreeing.
#
# What is lost: the README can drift from what the tap serves. That is a
# documentation staleness, not a correctness failure -- what gets installed is
# decided by bucket/, and that is still checked.
#
# Usage: check-products-consistent.sh [repo-root]   (default: the repo this
# lives in)

# Every comparison below is between sorted lists, and `sort` compares under the
# environment's collation. UTF-8 collations ignore punctuation at the primary
# level, so `pod-up` and `podup` -- both legal manifest names -- compare EQUAL
# and `sort -u` drops one. Two lists that genuinely differ then compare the
# same and this exits 0 over real drift. Pin the collation rather than inherit
# whatever the runner happens to have.
