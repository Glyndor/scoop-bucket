# scripts/render-manifests.sh's PRODUCTS table is the only place a product is
# declared. Two things restate it and cannot be generated from it: the README's
# "Available manifests" table, and the set of files under bucket/. With one
# product the drift is invisible; with the full roster it is certain.
#
# This lived inline in .github/workflows/ci.yml, where nothing could test it.
# A check that decides whether a tap agrees with itself, and that has never
# been watched fail, is decoration -- so it moved here and got a test.
#
# Usage: check-products-consistent.sh [repo-root]   (default: the repo this
# lives in)

# Every comparison below is between sorted lists, and `sort` compares under the

# level, so `pod-up` and `podup` -- both legal manifest names -- compare EQUAL
# and `sort -u` drops one. Two lists that genuinely differ then compare the
# same and this exits 0 over real drift. Pin the collation rather than inherit
# whatever the runner happens to have.
