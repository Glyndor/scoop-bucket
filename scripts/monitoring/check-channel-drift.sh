# Fail when a file this repository shares with Glyndor/homebrew-tap has drifted
# from the copy the tap publishes on its main branch.
#
# WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS
#
#   Thirty-five scripts and tests under scripts/ and tests/ are byte-identical
#   in both channel repositories: the same shell, the same CI policy, the same
#   tests. They are copies, and the duplication is deliberate -- it keeps every
#   repository in the publication path self-contained, so no outside repository
#   can change what a release does.
#
#   Nothing watched them. A fix applied to this repository's copy of a shared
#   check left the tap's copy behind, and from then on the two repositories
#   answered the same question differently: one refusing a manifest the other
#   published, one linting what the other let through. The reusable workflows
#   have their own watcher (check-reusable-drift.sh) and the render scripts
#   have theirs (check-render-drift.sh). These thirty-five files had none.
#
# WHAT IS COMPARED
#
#   The paths listed in scripts/monitoring/channel-shared-paths.txt, one per
#   line. The list is a data file rather than an array in this script, so that
#   adding or removing a shared file is a one-line change in the file whose
#   whole job is to be that list, and so that the list can be read without
#   reading this script.
#
# HOW THE COMPARISON IS MADE, and why it is a byte comparison
#
#   These files are copies, not two implementations of one idea, so the whole
#   text is the contract: a comment changed on one side only is a copy that
#   has stopped being a copy. The sibling checks are looser on purpose -- the
#   reusable workflows' comments legitimately name their own repository, and
#   the renderers share units rather than a whole file -- and a byte
#   comparison here would not misfire, because none of the thirty-five files
#   carries prose that belongs to one repository and not the other.
#
#   Two things are normalised before the comparison. Both are invisible to a
#   reader, and neither can hide a change in behaviour:
#
#     CRLF line endings    a checkout on Windows has CRLF files unless the
#                          repository says otherwise, and reporting thirty-five
#                          files as drifted because of the reader's line
#                          endings is a red nobody can act on.
#     trailing whitespace  an invisible byte at the end of a line must not
#                          masquerade as drift, and the diff of two lines that
#                          look the same is unreadable.
#
#   Comments and blank lines are NOT normalised away. They are part of the
#   copy.
#
# WHERE THE SIBLING COPY IS READ FROM
#
#   Over HTTPS from raw.githubusercontent.com, the same mechanism
#   check-reusable-drift.sh uses. The repository is public, so this needs no
#   token, no secret and no second checkout -- which matters, because handing
#   a drift reporter write reach it has no business having.
#
# FOUR OUTCOMES, KEPT DISTINCT ON PURPOSE
#
#   drift            a listed file's text differs; the path and the first
#                    differing line are named
#   absent           the file is missing on one side: not present here, or not
#                    served by the sibling (HTTP 404)
#   fetch failure    GitHub could not be reached, or answered with nothing.
#                    This is NOT reported as drift. Conflating an unreachable
#                    network with a real disagreement teaches people that a
#                    red check means "try again later", which is exactly the
#                    habit that lets a genuine one through.
#   nothing compared refuse to pass having inspected nothing (see the bottom)
#
# Usage: check-channel-drift.sh [repo-root] [path-list]
#        (defaults: the repo this lives in, and the list beside it)
