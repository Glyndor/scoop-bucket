# Report any commit on `main` that a person authored without a `Signed-off-by:`
# trailer.
#
# Detection, not prevention: by the time this runs the commit is already on the
# branch `scoop install` reads. See .github/workflows/dco-on-main.yml for why
# this repository cannot have a gate here and what prevention would take.
#
# Commits authored by github-actions[bot] are exempt. DCO is a person's
# attestation about their right to submit code; a bot regenerating a manifest
# from an already-verified release is not contributing in that sense, and
# emitting a trailer on its behalf would manufacture an attestation nobody made.
#
# Usage: check-dco-on-main.sh <before-sha> <after-sha>
#
# A zero <before-sha> (a branch's first push, or a force push GitHub reports
# that way) means there is no range to walk, so the tip alone is checked rather
# than the repository's whole history.
