# Report any commit on `main` that a person authored without a `Signed-off-by:`
# trailer.
#
# Detection, not prevention: by the time this runs the commit is already on the
# branch `scoop install` reads. See .github/workflows/dco-on-main.yml for why
# this repository cannot have a gate here and what prevention would take.
#
# Commits the bot made are exempt. DCO is a person's attestation about their
# right to submit code; a bot regenerating a manifest from an already-verified
# release is not contributing in that sense, and emitting a trailer on its
# behalf would manufacture an attestation nobody made.
#
# "The bot made it" is decided by WHO PUSHED, not by what the commit says about
# itself. The author name and email are set by whoever ran `git commit`:
# `git -c user.name='github-actions[bot]' commit` produces a commit this script
# exempted in its first version. The pusher comes from GitHub's event payload
# and cannot be set in a local git config.
#
# When the pusher is not supplied -- running by hand, or an event shape that
# does not carry one -- it falls back to the author field and SAYS SO in the
# log, rather than silently applying the weaker signal. A fallback nobody can
# see is how the weaker rule becomes the real one.
#
# Usage: check-dco-on-main.sh <before-sha> <after-sha> [pusher-login]
#
# A zero <before-sha> (a branch's first push, or a force push GitHub reports
# that way) means there is no range to walk, so the tip alone is checked rather
# than the repository's whole history.
