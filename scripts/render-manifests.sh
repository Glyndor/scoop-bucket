# Second slot, empty until a rotation is in flight. The org rotation is
# make-before-break: phase one publishes a release still signed with the old
# key that carries both, consumers pick the new one up, and only then does
# phase two sign with the new key. A renderer with a single slot cannot take
# part in that -- it would verify fine through phase one and start failing the
# moment phase two lands. And because this channel is pull-based, that failure
# is invisible: the render aborts, no manifest is updated, and the bucket
# simply stops moving on the last version it could verify. install.sh and
# install.ps1 have carried two slots for exactly this reason; this brings the
# bucket level with them.

# Bounds on the bytes this script reads off the network. The signature proves
# what the publisher meant, but it does not bound how much of it there is; the
# release assets are attacker-influenced (whoever can publish a release asset
# controls it), and the embedded python reads both files whole, so without a
# cap here an oversized signature or manifest would have every hourly run
# transfer and allocate whatever the publisher attached.
#
# The numbers, derived from what a legitimate file actually looks like:
#
#   MAX_SUMS_BYTES = 4096 (4 KiB). The current podup SHA256SUMS is two
#   `<64-hex>  <asset>\n` lines, ~160 bytes. Even a roster of dozens of
#   products with realistic Windows binary asset names lands well under a
#   kilobyte; 4 KiB is two orders of magnitude of headroom over today's file
#   and still fits comfortably under the size of a single apt sibling's
#   per-signature cap.
#
#   MAX_SIG_BYTES = 64, exact. A raw Ed25519 signature has no other valid
#   length, so any other size is by definition not a signature and is refused
#   the same way whether too large or too small. The check is an equality,
#   not a comparison: anything that is not 64 bytes is wrong here.
#
#   MAX_ASSET_BYTES = 104857600 (100 MiB). The cap on the binary that
#   verify_attestation downloads so its digest can be checked against
#   SHA256SUMS and so the SLSA attestation can be verified against the
#   claimed tag. Today's podup binaries are 5-8 MiB; 100 MiB is over ten
#   times the largest today and leaves room for Electron-class CLI
#   products. Anything larger is suspect as a denial-of-service: the
#   renderer holds the bytes while the attestation check runs.

# The only way to override it is --pubkey, which tests/render-manifests.test.sh

# Verify the build provenance of the release. The signature on SHA256SUMS
# proves the digests the renderer is about to write into formulae; it does
# not prove the digests came from THIS release. An actor who can publish a
# release can take last year's binaries, upload them under a new higher tag
# with the matching old SHA256SUMS and its valid old signature, and the
# renderer accepts them: every digest matches, the signature verifies, and
# the formula points users at old code under a new version number.
# Version monotonicity does not help; the fake tag is higher.
#
# GitHub's SLSA provenance attestations bind an artifact to the tag it was
# built from. A re-uploaded binary still carries the attestation naming its
# OLD tag, so verification against the new tag fails. That is the property
# that closes the gap. Two measured facts decide the shape of this
# function:
#
#   SHA256SUMS itself is NOT attested (`gh attestation verify` on it
#   answers HTTP 404). Only the built artifacts are, so the attested thing
#   has to be an artifact the renderer names.
#
#   `gh attestation verify` takes a file path or an OCI reference. It has
#   no digest-only mode, so the asset has to be downloaded to verify it.
#
# ONE asset per release is verified, not every referenced one. Every asset
# the release ships was built in the same workflow run, so a single
# attestation check proves the tag is honest; the SHA256SUMS is signed as
# a whole, so one downloaded asset's digest matching its SHA256SUMS entry
# extends the signature's trust to the entries the renderer does not
# download. Verifying every asset costs a download for no extra security.
#
# The chosen asset is the first non-dash one in the PRODUCTS table order;
# for podup that is podup-darwin-arm64 (the mac_arm slot). The download's
# SHA-256 is computed and checked against the SHA256SUMS entry for that
# asset before the attestation check runs, so the digest the renderer
# renders for it is the digest that was verified -- and the control
# inspects something rather than confirming two pieces of input agree
# without having read either.
#
# A release predating attestations is a different fault from a failed
# verification, and the message names which: one is "this release was not
# built by a workflow that emits provenance" and the other is "an
# attestation for this release names a different tag." Both fail closed;
