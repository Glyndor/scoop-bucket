# Fail when this repository's copy of a reusable workflow has drifted apart from
# the copies carried by the sibling channel repositories.
#
# The three channel repositories each carry their own copy of the same seven
# reusable workflows. That duplication is deliberate: it keeps every repository
# in the publication path self-contained, so no outside repository can change
# what a release does. Nothing, however, noticed when the copies stopped
# agreeing. Until this script existed, the only thing keeping them in step was
# somebody remembering to apply a fix three times, which is care rather than a
# mechanism, and care does not survive a busy week.
#
# HOW THE COMPARISON IS MADE, and why it is not a byte comparison:
#
#   Each copy's comments describe its own repository, so the prose legitimately
#   differs -- dco.yml, pr-hygiene.yml and workflow-lint.yml already differ in
#   comments only, and the seven reusables are byte-identical today. Comparing
#   bytes would therefore turn every honest, repository-specific comment edit
#   into a red check, and a gate that goes red for a correct change is a gate
#   people learn to click past. So comment-only lines and blank lines are
#   removed from both sides before the diff: a comment edit passes, a change to
#   a `run:` block, an input default or a permission does not.
#
# WHERE THE SIBLING COPIES ARE READ FROM:
#
#   Over HTTPS from raw.githubusercontent.com. The repositories are public, so
#   this needs no token, no secret and no second checkout -- which matters,
#   because handing this check a token would give a drift reporter write reach it
#   has no business having.
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, KEPT DISTINCT ON PURPOSE:
#
#   drift            a compared file's logic differs; the diff is printed
#   fetch failure    GitHub could not be reached, or answered with nothing.
#                    This is NOT reported as drift. Conflating an unreachable
#                    network with a real disagreement teaches people that a red
#                    check means "try again later", which is exactly the habit
#                    that lets a genuine one through.
#   nothing compared refuse to pass having inspected nothing (see the bottom)
#
# Usage: check-reusable-drift.sh [repo-root]   (default: the repo this lives in)
